This is a simple shopping cart website I created for the purpose of learning PHP. 

If you want to view the website locally, make sure you have PHP installed and run the following command in the command prompt (the directory in which you have these files saved):
```console
php -S localhost:4000
```
then open an internet browser and navigate to the site "localhost:4000".

`index.php` is the entry point. `cart.json` is the file system for storing which items you have in the cart. You can delete this file if you like; the program will automatically create a new one.

## Screenshots
