In 2019 I completed **STATS 369** at The Univerity of Auckland, a practical data science course. *I am not able to upload my assignments and labs from this course publicly; however, if you would like to see them, please get in touch; I have permission from my lecturer to show them privately.*

In STATS 369 we used the **R** language and **Rmarkdown**. The following are some of the skills/techniques I learnt:
- **Data preparation:** feature engineering, test/train sets, null value imputation, plotting (`ggplot`), function mapping, join (inner, outer, etc.), groupby, etc.
- **Model selection:** forward/backward selection with the `leaps` package, success metrics (e.g. MSPE), confusion matrices, feature importance, cross validation
- **Machine learning models:** linear regression, ridge/lasso regression (`glmnet`), tree classification/regression (`rpart`), tree pruning,  random forests (`ranger`), gradient boosted trees (`xboost`), neural networks introduction (`keras`)

[**Titanic dataset exploratory analysis assignment.pdf**](https://github.com/HenryAlferink/PORTFOLIO/blob/main/Data_Science/Titanic%20dataset%20exploratory%20analysis%20assignment.pdf). 

This is a university assignment I completed in 2018 (grade: 94%). It involves an **exploratory data analysis** of ye olde titanic dataset, a look at **k-means clustering**, and a **tree classification** model.
