# Initial Cleanup of a new React App

- You may want to delete the following files:
  - logo.svg
  - App.test.js
  - index.css
  - reportWebVitals.js (??)
- You'll then need to remove these imports from index.js and App.js.
- You may also want to remove everything inside the <div> element in App.js.
