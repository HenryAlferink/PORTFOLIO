## Highlights
### [Interactive Introduction to Bayesian Inverse Problems](https://share.streamlit.io/henryalferink/portfolio/main/Honours_Project/Code/Streamlit_app/Ballistics_Problem_Streamlit.py)
Click on the link to see a primer on Bayesian inverse problems that I made. This was a small part of the work I did in my Engineering Science honours project.

### Antarctica Network Science project
Here is an image of one of the networks I created as part of this project.

**Antarctica species-habitat bipartite network representation produced with Gephi.** *(If I remember correctly:) White nodes are habitats; all other nodes are Antarctic species. Node size represents total number of occurrences of a species node, or the number of species within the habitat if a habitat node. Colour of the species node represents the number of habitats it is found in (can also be seen by looking at the number of links leaving the node).*
