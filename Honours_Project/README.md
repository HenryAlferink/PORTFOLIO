# How much is data worth in geothermal engineering? (2020)

1. [**Click here to see an interactive introduction to Bayesian inverse problems.**](https://share.streamlit.io/henryalferink/portfolio/main/Honours_Project/Code/Streamlit_app/Ballistics_Problem_Streamlit.py)
2. [**NZGW conference paper.pdf**](https://github.com/HenryAlferink/PORTFOLIO/blob/main/Honours_Project/NZGW%20conference%20paper.pdf). A conference paper I co-authored for the NZ Geothermal Workshop. I was primarily responsible for writing section 4.1.
3. [**Data worth analysis for geophysical problems.pdf**](https://github.com/HenryAlferink/PORTFOLIO/blob/main/Honours_Project/Data%20worth%20analysis%20for%20geophysical%20problems.pdf). My honours project final report.
4. [**Code**](https://github.com/HenryAlferink/PORTFOLIO/tree/main/Honours_Project/Code)
    * [**Streamlit_app**](https://github.com/HenryAlferink/PORTFOLIO/tree/main/Honours_Project/Code/Streamlit_app). Code for the interactive introduction mentioned above.
    * [**3 Source Recovery Bayesian Inversion.ipynb**](https://github.com/HenryAlferink/PORTFOLIO/blob/main/Honours_Project/Code/3%20Source%20Recovery%20Bayesian%20Inversion.ipynb). Code for working with the inverse problems part of my project.
    * [**4 Source Recovery Data Worth.ipynb**](https://github.com/HenryAlferink/PORTFOLIO/blob/main/Honours_Project/Code/4%20Source%20Recovery%20Data%20Worth.ipynb). Code that deals with the data worth analysis part of my project.

**Figure 1.** In overly-simplistic terms, our goal in this project was to reduce the size of those error bands as much as possible!
